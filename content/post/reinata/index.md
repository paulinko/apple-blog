The Reinata apple is imported from France here in Gran Canaria. It is a tart apple with very little sweetness and a mealy consistency.
The breed is very old and was described as early as 1540 by Frenchman Charles Etienne.
Its name is probably derived from the French word for queen, la reine. The bronze golden color of this apple truly fits its name.
I personally like the taste and consistency. If you have no problem with soft apples, and you like sour fruit, this is a very nice apple.

Price: 2.99â‚¬ per kg / 3-4 medium Apples (non organic)
