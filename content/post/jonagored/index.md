Jonagored is a medium sized apple with a sweet taste. It is not very sour.

The one I got at the grocery store is a bit watery. But if you put it in the fridge during sommer time it's very refreshing.
I was surprised to learn that Jonagored was discovered very recently in 1986, which makes it a newer apple breed. 
The apple is a variant of the Jonagold apple with a more reddish color, therefore the name. Its harvested in summer and available through autumn and winter in Germany.

Price: 2.99â‚¬ per kg / 6 medium Apples (non organic)

Rating: 6/10
