"Fräulein" (German for Miss or little lady) is a apple breed I discovered in my grocery store recently.

Its packaging touts a happy accident crossbreed and the apple itself looks a lot like my all time favorite, Boskoop. The apples I bought had no discernable smell but they had the matt colour and big calibre I associate with a delicious old apple breed.

The taste was a bit underwhelming for me. It was sweet and sour and crisp, but it did not have the apple aroma of a Boskoop. The taste reminds me of a nice Elstar. All in all, a solid apple. If you love crisp, not to sweet apples, this apple may be for you.


Price: 2.99€ per kg / 4 big Apples (non organic)
