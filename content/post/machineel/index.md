The machineel apple is the fruit of the highly poisonous machineel tree. It also goes by the name apple of death. 
Every part of the machineel tree is highly toxic for humans. The fluids and sap of the tree cause lasting scars on human skin and eating one of the small fruits would mean a painful death.
Its flavour is described as sweet at first, but with a peppery, stinging aftertaste.  Definitely not worth dying for.
You cannot buy the small death apples in stores. But the trees can be found at coastlines in Panama or Florida where there prevent erosion of the soil.

Price: N/A
